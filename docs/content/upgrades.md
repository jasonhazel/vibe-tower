## Weapon Upgrades

### Scope
- Upgrades apply to a specific weapon instance unless stated otherwise.
- Presented as perks in level-up offers; follow rarity and tiering rules.

### Allowed Axes
- **Damage**: Increase per-hit or per-tick damage.
- **Speed**: Reduce interval or increase rate of fire/trigger frequency.
- **Range**: Increase effective radius or targeting distance.
- **Projectile Count**: For projectile weapons only, increase simultaneous projectiles.

### Rules
- Upgrades are tiered; higher tiers provide stronger effects or unlock new caps.
- Diminishing returns may apply at defined breakpoints to protect pacing.
- Some upgrades may be mutually exclusive to preserve distinct build identities.
- Global caps per axis prevent infinite scaling during very long runs.
- Offer logic avoids dead picks (e.g., projectile count is not offered to non-projectile weapons).

### Offer & Stacking Behavior
- Duplicate upgrades stack according to axis-specific rules and caps.
- Rerolls and banishes affect the pool but do not break rarity weighting.
- Upgrades clearly indicate affected weapon and projected impact at selection time.
